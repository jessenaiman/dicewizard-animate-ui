# Nebulix Blog

Welcome to the fantasy‑themed blog import. This section uses a parchment look and serif typography reminiscent of Homebrewery.

## Getting started

- Drop legacy Markdown posts into this folder as `.mdx` files.
- Use standard MDX headings, lists, and blockquotes; they’ll adopt the theme.

> Example blockquote to showcase the ink‑style rule.

### Sample section

Here’s a paragraph with emphasis and a link to the original project.
