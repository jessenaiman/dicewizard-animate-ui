description: Quick reference for project-wide styling and animation rules.

- Imports: prefer named imports from `motion/react`.
- Animation defaults: `stiffness: 150`, `damping: 22` (spring).
- Component slots: use `data-slot` attributes as styling hooks.
- Import transforms: registry output rewrites `@/registry/` to `@/components/animate-ui/`.
- Screenshot mode: toggle `screenshot-mode` class in `layout.tsx` for recording.
