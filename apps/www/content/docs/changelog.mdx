### v1.0.0

**Animate UI** is no longer in beta.

In order to make Animate UI more accessible and simpler, we are introducing a new organization.
Animate UI is now divided into three parts:

- **Primitives**: Primary components, animated but without style.
- **Components**: Ready-to-use components styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Icons**: Animated icons based on Lucide Icons.

**All components have been reworked** to be improved and optimized.

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** This update contains significant changes compared to the last beta
  version. As Animate UI is no longer in beta, this structure should remain
  stable over time. We recommend that you use only the components in this new
  version.

#### Components

**Community**:

The new community category contains animated components contributed by the community. Unlike other Animate UI components, they arenâ€™t required to use our primitives, so their APIs may vary and some may offer limited configuration (few or no props).

The goal is to make it easy for anyone to publish and share animated components with the community.

See the [roadmap page here](./roadmap).

See the [getting started guide here](./installation).

#### MCP

We have updated the MCP page to show you how to use the MCP shadcn/ui with Animate UI.

See the [MCP page here](./mcp).

#### Other animated distributions
